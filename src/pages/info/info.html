        <ion-card-content>
          Check with your cellphone provider as to whether there is anything that you need to do to set-up international roaming and make sure that this is set-up before you leave. You can get a Chinese sim card over there, but you may need to use your phone before then. For example, if any flights are delayed or to notify family that you have arrived. You should also check your providerâ€™s roaming charges and be careful as your bill can rise rapidly. It is a good idea to turn your data off.
Provide your Chinese cellphone number to Will as soon as possible.
Carry a charged phone with you at all times and load it with all vital contact details.

Remember to take a power plug adapter for charging your phone.
